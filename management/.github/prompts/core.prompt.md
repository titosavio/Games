We are making a management 2d game in Godot 4.4.1.

We are using GDscript for its similarity with python which is my main programing language.

The core concepts are:

THEME: it is a village manager, we'll gather resources and the village will grow.

CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP: the player will gather resources, place new building to automate that process and grow the village accordingly. More resources, more bulding, etc A "Factorio"/city builder

GOAL: grow as big of a village as possible, bigger productions, less bottlenecks, etc

SCOPE: minimal for now, maybe the project might grow, but it is a single weekend learning kind of project
